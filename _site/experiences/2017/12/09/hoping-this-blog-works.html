<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A little over a year ago, some colleagues and I decided to create an organization that would provide a safe space and community for Software Engineers of color. We called it Black Code Collective (BCC). Since BCC has come to fruition, I have sometimes had people ask me why such a community is necessary. Questioning why people of color just don’t join the tech groups that are already in existence. For some white people, people of color (POCs) separating themselves can come across as backwards, but I’m hoping to shed some light on why we sometimes choose to do so.

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>For a black person in corporate America,  majority of their time is spent being one of a few black people (if not the only). Just like the outside world, white is the default at work, and this default brings about an unspoken burden for POCs. We sometimes fear that if we make a misstep at work, it will trigger the unconscious bias within our peers. Causing them to associate us with the “bad POCs” and potentially assume that we only have our position because of affirmative action or similar race quotas. With an organization like BCC, this stress is momentarily lifted from  a POCs shoulders. They are among individuals that they can relate to and are more likely to feel comfortable asking questions. Asking questions is a key way for a person to learn and grow, but if they’re in an environment where they’re too nervous to ask questions, that growth can be stunted. Not only does this brief break from reality give a POC a chance to ask questions and sharpen their skills, it can be a sanity check to have someone tell you that your question isn’t stupid, and say that they too struggled with that topic. Potentially inspiring you to speak up when you’re back in an environment where you’re the only one.
